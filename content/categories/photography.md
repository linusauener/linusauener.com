These are some of the favorite photos I've taken with my dslr camera. The camera used is either my Sony a6000 or Canon EOS 6D and the images are edited in Adobe lightroom. The picture on display was taken for a school contest by shooting with a slow shutter speed while moving a burning match around the glass.
