This is my attempt to recreate the famous raptors in the kitchen scene from Jurassic Park in the free 3d software Blender. This animation was made from scratch, although I loosely followed [Critical Giant's](https://www.youtube.com/c/CriticalGiants) youtube videos on how to sculpt and rig dinosaurs since this was my first finished attempt at making a CG dinosaur. Most of the sounds in the video are from the original JP movie but retimed to fit my animation.
